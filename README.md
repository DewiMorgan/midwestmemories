# Project: midwestmemories

Photo archive for the family.

## Current structure

When a change is made in Dropbox, a Dropbox callback hook calls DropboxWebhook.php.
This tags the user's cursor as "dirty", but doesn't actually download any updated files.

Admins can log in and manually initiate an update through admin.php.
Maybe in the future this could be automated by DropboxWebhook.php or a periodic cron.

Index.php shows the nav, and the image listings.

## What we actually want:

* File structure nav panel of folders.
* Each folder shows all thumbnails and folders within it.
* Each thumbnail can be expanded to full details on that file.
* Full details can be edited.
* Edited details can be saved.
* Images and details are in Dropbox.

## Planned Features

* Get namespaces and autoloading working per PSR.
* Get testing working (again check PSR).
* Hierarchical nav with breadcrumbs.
* Copy from file structure.
* Mirror to/from dropbox.
* Audit trail.
* Access restrict.
* Sort and search by date, photographer, location, subjects, etc.
* Rename photo subjects: choose to see thumbs of other pics with that person in, with a checkbox to change any of them.
* Audited, undoable through admin.

## Objects

* Photo group/album: name, written notes, visitor notes, creation date.
* Photo: date, photographer, location, subjects, written notes, visitor notes, upload date.
* Subject: person or unknown or object.
* Object (place or thing): location?, notes, creation date.
* Person: name, relation to family tree, notes, addition date.
* Unknown: Unique ID, and other pics that specific unknown is in.

## How it should work (Phase 1)

* Initially, params. Later, mod-rewrite.
* path: path to folder. (later, search=search terms)
* In folders: index.txt file (or HTML?) contains default values.

* Display breadcrumb, album notes, and all images as thumbs in a fluid table. Likely need to generate thumbnails.
* Clicking individual images shows image details and the image.

## Dev/Test workflow

1) Open the project in PHPStorm EAP (OK, in PHPStorm regular: I went and bought the license).
2) In Bash, do "service mysql start". See MySqAuth.ini for auth info.
3) Browser tab: cpanel from https://porkbun.com/account/webhosting/dewimorgan.com -> file manager.
4) Browser tab: https://dewimorgan.com/midwestmemories/inst-mwm.php to run the git pull.
5) Browser tab: https://midwestmemories.dewimorgan.com/admin.php to admin it.
6) Browser tab: https://midwestmemories.dewimorgan.com/ to view the actual content.

To push a change:

1) Git push in PHPStorm.
2) Git pull in inst-mwm.

What do the commands in the admin page MEAN?

**Initialize root cursor**:
Logs the system into Dropbox, pulling down (and ignoring!) the listing of ALL files.
Not normally needed, as it maintains the cursor periodically.
If this page hangs/times out, after showing just the heading, that's OK. Give it a few minutes, then go to the next.

**Continue initializing the root cursor**: Continues downloading and ignoring that list of files,
If it timed out the first time. You can tell it to start at a certain offset, ignoring the first N files,
but that isn't necessary, and the default is fine.
Again, this is just initialization stuff, should never be needed.

**Handle Queued Files**: This is where it gets the list of new files and puts them in the DB.
This is the list of files that have changed since the last file most recently listed by any of the above two commands.
This part (but not the download/thumbnail) *should* happen automatically from the DropboxWebhook callback.

This also downloads those new files from the previous command.

This also makes thumbnails, publicly publishes the files, etc.

## Templating flow

* /index.php::global - All user page processing starts here. Sets up autoloading, new Index(), and exits.
* app/Index.php::__construct() - Handles session and path.
* app/Index.php::showPage() - `i` param unset means user request: include TreeTemplate.
* app/TreeTemplate.php::global - display left-bar, set an onLoad JS to load body page.
* app/TreeTemplate.php::scanDirectory() - display left-bar, set an onLoad JS to load body page, add drag-bar listeners.
* app/TreeTemplate.php:JS:handleDragBar*() - handle drag-bar resizing.
* app/TreeTemplate.php:JS:openLinkInline() - handle onLoad and onClick, to load target into "content" div & fix history.
* /index.php::global & app/Index.php::__construct() - as above, but for the subpage.
* app/Index.php::showPage() - `i` param set by JS means internal request: include FileTemplate, ThumbsTemplate, etc.

Templates have one script and stylesheet in their header, both parsed into the parent when they are read inline.

## ToDo:

* Display images in a folder with next/previous.
* PHP 8 features: readonly properties and promoted properties.
* Display info texts with folders.
* Allow users to add more info texts.
* Allow click people/things to name them, stores position in the pic.
* OR: allow creation of clickable faces in a pic, maybe manually.
* Highlight the clicked area when you mouseover a name?
* Search for all images of a person when you click their name.
* Display images in a search result-set with next/previous.
* Delete files deleted from dropbox?

## Current Issues

See also ToDo, above.

Current task:

* I broke file downloads from dropbox.

* Editing a user's password no longer shows it as edited until you reload.
* adding a new user no longer works.

* Handle API errors instead of just checking `result.ok` (which just checks it was a 200).
    * Also make API errors not return 200 OK.
* Maybe in add users, make save button grey out until both username and password are filled? Or just give error on save?
* Improve admin UI: add "Are you sure" to cursor renewal.
* Correctly handle (and prevent) users that try to set their passwords to the string 'DISABLED'.

* Get it commentable.
    * sanitise comments
    * allow some rich text: bold and links and such.
    * CSS to make comments usable.
    * Clean up debugging output from files template.
    * Hide a bunch of unused fields in files template table output.
* Lower priority
    * API to edit comments.
    * Javascript to edit comments.
    * API to hide comments.
    * Admin Javascript to edit comments.
    * Convert template loading to an API? Have the API specify what script to run on display of a page?

* Get it usable on a phone.
* Search template?

* Comments
    * Optimize adding comments, by show/hide the textarea instead of removing and recreating it all the time.

* ThumbsTemplate
    * https://midwestmemories.dewimorgan.com/?path=%2FDewi%2F2 doesn't fill img names/title from Metadata.
    * In ThumbsTemplate, we need to populate things like $h_pageTitle per instructions in comment at top of that file.
        * The data is stored/read into Metadata. Treat same as FileTemplate.
    * Ini files don't handle subfolder details. Probably details should come from ini files in subfolders?
    * Folder Descriptions from Dropbox\midwestmemories\Auora\Horst and Karin slide tray sections.txt.
        * The descriptions are short enough, it feels like it'd maybe be worth also showing them on the page for each
          file, as context of what's going on in the pic.
    * At certain widths in the folder "section 1", one image goes to a second line, giving row lengths of 7, 7, 1, 7, 3.

* TreeTemplate
    * Left navbar should be overflow:scroll.
    * Bug: fail to resize right-bar: drag bar left, then ctrl+m-wheel down.
    * Feature? Clicking folder thumbs doesn't open *parent* folders if the current was collapsed.
    * Add some visual hint to the drag-bar to show it can be dragged. Like a vertically-centered "â‹®" or something.
    * Using "fold/folder" is confusing, replace with collapse/collapser.
    * Can we get rid of the `i` param and replace it with leading /img, /api, /tpl, /search, etc.?

* Metadata class
    * Add hasNext and hasPrev properties to enable next/prev buttons in FileTemplate.
    * data from all parent folders isn't loaded at all.
    * Saving inherited data: do we save it only if it was modified? Seems sensible.
    * How do we distinguish inherited data in the returned data structure?
    * Should I instead have a getInheritedValue($filename, $key), for templates to call for missing values?
    * Versioned comments: how to represent, store, and so on? Just backup copies of the ini file? In a backup subfolder?
    * File w no data in ini file, getFileDetails returns empty array: should be populated w empty fields.
    * PHP: Parse Metadata TO ini file.
    * PHP: Parse Metadata TO database.
    * PHP: Parse Metadata FROM database.
    * PHP: Parse Metadata TO web form.
    * PHP: Parse Metadata FROM web form.
    * PHP: Display ini file contents in inline file view, tagged by type.
    * Single-line string (strip WS, strip HTML, replace \n), fixed length (display chars remaining once close/over).
    * Multi-line string (strip WS, strip HTML), unlimited or fixed length (display chars remaining once close/over).
    * Date
    * User selector (like single line string, but with drop-down hint picker)
    * Location picker (ditto)
    * Keyword picker (ditto)
    * Each with who-can-edit level (nobody, owner, admin, regular, guest)

* FileTemplate
    * https://midwestmemories.dewimorgan.com/?path=%2FDewi%2F2%2Ftest1.gif
    * Add next/prev buttons (disappear when editing? Or just prompt to save?)
    * Better formatting for visitor notes (nl2br?).
    * MVP for editing: just "add a comment".
    * Add edit button to change fields to editable.
        * Switch view mode to edit mode on edit button click? All fields edit-on-click? Always editable? Pen by each?
    * Style this template.
        * Display the file, centered, scaled to the window.
        * The various fields, both for display and for editing.
    * How do we visually distinguish inherited data from local data?
        * Is there even a programmatic difference?
        * We don't care about this for now.
        * I think inherited data should be greyed out. Editing it saves locally. Button to go to page of parent/origin?
    * CSS: Make the inline file view look like not ass.
    * The title at the top is mostly useless and takes up space, I think I'll remove it.
    * It would be nice to let the user able to toggle between ice/non-ice if available.
    * Bug: the slide numbers at the end are reversed from how they are in the filename.
    * Bug: The field for "text on the slide" is above the table, rather than in it.

* DropboxManager
    * Split off upload handling/parsing methods to their own class.

* Admin:
    * https://midwestmemories.dewimorgan.com/admin.php?action=list_files_to_download no longer works.
    * Make cursor-ignoring be dynamic, too.
        * Mostly done, need to make the AdminApiTemplate handle that too.
        * Pretty up that template bit: need a styled, scrolling output window.
        * Maybe merge the template and Admin.php together, and get the JS out to a .js file.
    * Move Git pull and log clearing into the admin.php.
    * Investigate cursor init that isn't just always-ignore, and download that isn't just always-download.
        * Detect changes! Dropbox may suck until I can do this. Or hide cursor regen as super-admin.
        * Base it on date (beware timezones)? Checksum?
    * Make updating be triggered by visiting the admin page.
    * If the webhook was working then I shouldn't be able to do a manual update. But I could, and did!
    * I think file downloads are no longer checked against the right folder path. VALID_FILE_PATH_REGEX is unused.
        * SaveFileQueue() probably does it, hardcoded.

* https://midwestmemories.dewimorgan.com/?path=%2FDewi%2F2 should be https://midwestmemories.dewimorgan.com/Dewi/2
    * (mod_rewrite)
* PHP: Parse form input to database, with validation, errors, etc.
* JS: Parse and display form errors.
* Index: Inline search view.
* ThumbsTemplate: Alt text when displaying images.
* ThumbsTemplate: Display title.
* ThumbsTemplate: Display breadcrumbs?
* ThumbsTemplate: Check width and height when displaying images.
* Some kinda push tech to display error messages through Javascript in Index::ShowError().
* Update the URL as the page changes.
* "Download files from DB queue" and "Process downloaded files" are both giving me:
    * `Cursor='',"Cursor was not set in client."`, but I am not sure if that is even a true error.
    * No reproduction steps yet.

From Code comments:

* Admin: Chain all admin processes up from the web hook handler, using a single timeout time.
* Admin: Maybe have admin processes re-trigger each other or something.
* Admin: Maybe a web cron to hit the webhook? Or does cpanel allow cron jobs? Edit crontab manually?
* `inst-mwm`: Delete `inst-mwm.php`
* Admin: Make Admin.php ShowPage() a template.
* Admin: Wrap InitSession() logging in a connectionLogger.
* Index: Wrap InitSession() logging in a connectionLogger.
* Connection: isBot to use BotSign table.
* Connection: Do something with the ipLookup table.
* Connection: Timestamps with timezone-aware display.
* Connection: Make admin levels more DB-configurable.
* Connection: Ability to register accounts (with authorization)
* Connection: Ability to change passwords
* DropboxManager::processTextFile(): Some processing.
* DropboxManager::convertToJpeg(): How should this be reflected in the DB?

Low priority:

* Prettify the admin page, put the streaming actions into a separate box, show a list of errors needing attention, etc.
* Make ALL admin processing use same dynamic endpoint pattern as downloads and thumbnails.
* Parallelize maybe 4 downloads and thumbnail generations at a time?
* come up with a fun thumbnail image for the website to go in the upper left of the tab.

* TreeTemplate
    * ToDo: Migrate TreeTemplate's JS out to TreeTemplate.js.
    * ToDo: Migrate ScanDirectory out to... maybe Path.php? Its own file?
    * ToDo: Make it accept one or more callbacks to say how to recurse into, skip, or display entries.
    * Why?

* Index: Additional file types (TXT|SVG|BMP|WEBP?).
    * Add a template
    * Edit filters in existing templates.
    * Edit DropBoxManager upload handlers.
* Migrate templates into a sub-folder.
* Files within the mm folder aren't navigable to.
* site.webmanifest file could do with populating properly.
* Allow log level to be specified as a string
* Split a FileProcessor class out from DropboxManager?
* Log rolling.
* It logs the connection twice for each page load, because of the way templates work.
    * Could maybe not log unless `i` is set, or error?
* Create an always-present error-div, that's shown if it has any content. Sorta like an in-page console.
* Handle empty folders.
* ThumbsTemplate: indent HTML lines for file list.
* Dark mode
* MetadataCleaner::cleanNamesInData():
    * Optional param $checkExists to accept only pre-existing names?
    * This is why they're all bundled together, so it can be done in one query.
    * Restrict the characters that can be in a name? Remove <script>, etc.

* Future: limit to N items/page.
* Future: Next/prev page pagination controls at top and bottom of page.
* Future: "N items per page" option.
* Future: search box, advanced search link.
    * Clicking names shows table of search results for that name.
    * Clicking locations show nearby images.
    * Clicking dates shows images with a date range search.
* Future: back up db data to dropbox.
* For now, we only need to use dropbox in the admin page, so it should be secure.
* Future: download zip of an album or search result. Let them choose between original images, or jpgs.
* Future: create webhooks for Dropbox to call when the folder is updated.
* Future: upload thumbs and jpgs and updated txt files to dropbox?
