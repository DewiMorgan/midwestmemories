# Project: midwestmemories

Photo archive for the family.

##

Current structure:

When a change is made in Dropbox, a Dropbox callback hook calls dropboxcallback.php.
This tags the user's cursor as "dirty", but doesn't actually download any updated files.

Admins can log in and manually initiate an update through admin.php.
Maybe in the future this could be automated by dropboxcallback.php or a periodic cron.

Index.php shows the nav, and the image listings.


## Planned Features

* Hierarchical nav with breadcrumbs.
* Copy from file structure.
* Mirror to/from dropbox.
* Audit trail.
* Access restrict.
* Sort and search by date, photographer, location, subjects, etc.
* Rename photo subjects: choose to see thumbs of other pics with that person in, with a checkbox to change any of them.
* Audited, undoable through admin.

## Objects

* Photo group/album: name, written notes, visitor notes, creation date.
* Photo: date, photographer, location, subjects, written notes, visitor notes, upload date.
* Subject: person or unknown or object.
* Object (place or thing): location?, notes, creation date.
* Person: name, relation to family tree, notes, addition date.
* Unknown: Unique ID, and other pics that specific unknown is in.

## How it should work (Phase 1)

* Initially, params. Later, mod-rewrite.
* path: path to folder. (later, search=search terms)
* In folders: index.txt file (or HTML?) contains default values.

* Display breadcrumb, album notes, and all images as thumbs in a fluid table. Likely need to generate thumbnails.
* Clicking individual images shows image details and the image.
* Future: limit to N items/page.
* Future: Next/prev page pagination controls at top and bottom of page.
* Future: "N items per page" option.
* Future: search box, advanced search link.
    * Clicking names shows table of search results for that name.
    * Clicking locations show nearby images.
    * Clicking dates shows images with a date range search.

* Future: back up db data to dropbox.
* For now, we only need to use dropbox in the admin page, so it should be secure.
* Future: download zip of an album or search result. Let them choose between original images, or jpgs.
* Future: create webhooks for Dropbox to call when the folder is updated.
* Future: upload thumbs and jpgs and updated txt files to dropbox?

## ToDo:

Next:

* Download files added to dropbox.
* Create thumbnails for all files.
* Create jpgs for over-sized pngs.
* Display thumbnails with a click-through to the images.
* Display images in a folder with next/previous.

Then:

* PHP 8 features: readonly properties and promoted properties. Strict typing everywhere!
* Parse info texts.
* Display info texts with folders and images.
* Allow users to add more info texts.
* Allow click people/things to name them, stores position in the pic.
* OR: allow creation of clickable faces in a pic, maybe manually.
* Highlight the clicked area when you mouseover a name?
* Search for all images of a person when you click their name.

Later:

* Display images in a search result-set with next/previous.
* Delete files deleted from dropbox?
